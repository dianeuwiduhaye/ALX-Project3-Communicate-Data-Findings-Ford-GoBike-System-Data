# Ford GoBike System Data
## by Diane Uwiduhaye


## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
The dataset has a total of 183412 observations, and 15 variables.
There were 6 variables with missing values, 2 variables with more missing values were member_birth_year and member_gender with 8265 which is 4.3% of the total data points of the entire dataset.
The Features included in the Data are as follows :

Member Year of Birth Member Gender User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual) Trip Duration(in seconds) Bike ID Start Time and Date End Time and Date Start Station ID End Station ID Start Station Name End Station Name End Station Latitude End Station Longitude Start Station Latitude Start Station Longitude

## Questions
When are most trips taken in terms of time of day, day of the week, or month of the year?


How long does the average trip take?


Does the above depend on if a user is a subscriber or custome


## Summary of Findings

Weekdays usually busier than weekends, maybe because people don't have work or schools. Thursdays and Tuesdays usually the busiest days of the week. On user types, there were more male riders than female, and most members were subscribers compared to non-subscribers(customers). Most users did not want to share bikes for all their trips. Most users are aged 20 to 40 years. Duration taken by users were short, most lasted between 5 to 10 minutes, though there were some very long outliers like 24hrs. The Other gender recorded longest duration compared to female and male while males recorded the least duration. Bike usage is higher during the week than during weekends. More males use bikes during the week than any females and other gender. Subscribers record higher bike usage across the week than customers. Thursdays and Tuesdays are the busiest days of the week. Other gender seem to have much older users that females and males. Females tends to be the youngest users. Average subscriber age is slightly higher than customer age. Other gender recorded highest duration usage compared to females and males across the week. The shorter duration usage for subscribers may show that they are probably using their bikes to go to work or they are just used to riding and not as excited as customers. The subscribers also seems to be open to sharing, perhaps to reduce cost.

## Key Insights for Presentation
Bike riding in San Francisco was observed to have more fans among male gender group than the rest.
Riders aged between 20 and 40 years old ride longer than compared to others.
Bike users are mostly the ones who have subscribed compared to those who haven't.
Thurdays and Tuesdays are the most favorable days for bike users.
